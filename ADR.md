# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) for Slack Bot

## ADR 1: Choice of Golang for Slack Bot Implementation

### Context

The implementation language for the Slack Bot needs to be chosen to ensure efficient integration with the Slack API and seamless communication with Kubernetes clusters.

### Decision

Golang is selected as the implementation language for the Slack Bot due to its strong support for concurrent programming, efficient performance, and a rich set of libraries, including the official Slack API library for Go. Golang's simplicity and speed align with the requirements of building a responsive and reliable Slack Bot.

### Consequences

- Golang provides a robust foundation for building a performant Slack Bot that can handle concurrent interactions and communication with Kubernetes clusters efficiently.
- Developers can benefit from Golang's simplicity and ease of maintenance, ensuring the agility of the development process.

## ADR 2: Use of Kubernetes Clusters for Multi-Environment Deployment

### Context

Choosing the deployment strategy for managing application versions across different environments (`dev`, `qa`, `stag`, `prod`).

### Decision

Using separate Kubernetes clusters for each environment is chosen to ensure clear separation and isolation. Each cluster corresponds to a specific environment, allowing for independent development, testing, staging, and production deployment processes.

### Consequences

- Clear environment separation minimizes the risk of errors and ensures a consistent deployment process.
- Isolation of environments enhances security and stability, providing a controlled environment for each stage of development.

## ADR 3: Adoption of FluxCD for GitOps Implementation

### Context

Selecting the tool for implementing GitOps principles to manage both infrastructure and application changes.

### Decision

FluxCD is chosen for the implementation of GitOps. It allows the description of the state of infrastructure and applications as code using Flux manifests. Storing these manifests in a Git repository enables versioning, traceability, and automated deployment processes.

### Consequences

- FluxCD facilitates the GitOps approach, providing a version-controlled and auditable representation of the desired state of the system.
- Automation of deployment processes improves efficiency and reduces the likelihood of manual errors.

## ADR 4: Integration with Helm OCI Registry for Helm Charts

### Context

Selecting a centralized repository for storing Helm charts to manage application deployment.

### Decision

The Helm OCI Registry is adopted as a centralized repository for Helm charts. This choice ensures a standardized and reliable source for packaging Kubernetes applications and their dependencies.

### Consequences

- Centralized storage of Helm charts in the Helm OCI Registry streamlines versioning and deployment processes.
- Helm charts in the registry enhance reproducibility and stability in deploying applications across different environments.

## ADR 5: Using of Slack for User Interaction and Feedback

### Context

Choosing a user-friendly and widely adopted platform for users to interact with the Slack Bot.

### Decision

Slack is selected as the communication platform for user interactions and feedback. The Slack Bot processes user commands and provides real-time feedback in Slack channels.

### Consequences

- Integration with Slack enhances collaboration among development teams.
- Real-time feedback and notifications in Slack channels improve visibility into the versioning and deployment processes.
